    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These lemon ricotta pancakes are lovely served with a pat of butter, 
      a pinch of lemon zest, and a drizzle of maple syrup. If these pancakes
      were any lighter, they would float off the plate — and I didn't even 
      separate the eggs and whip the whites. 
      Also, I used water instead of milk; I liked them better this way.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup cold water or milk</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (just the yellow part of the skin)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together cold water and baking soda in a mixing bowl. 
        Add ricotta cheese, egg, lemon zest, vegetable oil, sugar, and 
        vanilla; whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk in 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour, melted butter,
        and lemon juice until most of flour disappears into batter. 
        Let batter sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the hot griddle and cook until 
        bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. 
        Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. 
        Repeat with remaining batter.
      </li>
    </ol>
